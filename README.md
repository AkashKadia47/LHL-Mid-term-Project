# Project Flow

# Project Objective: 
The aim of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis to determine the correlation between the number of likes received by a video and its corresponding number of views.

# Data Gathering: 
Utilize the YouTube API to collect relevant data on videos, including information on the number of likes and views. Ensure that the acquired data is comprehensive and representative.

# Data Cleaning and Data Frame Creation: 
Clean the gathered data by removing outliers, handling missing values, and addressing any inconsistencies. Organize the cleaned data into appropriate data frames, ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

# Model Construction and Result: 
Develop a statistical or machine learning model to investigate the relationship between the number of likes and views of videos. Apply the constructed model to the prepared data frames and generate the corresponding results.

# Hypothesis Testing and Conclusion: 
Perform hypothesis testing to determine the validity of the statement. Based on the results, evaluate the null hypothesis, which states that the variable "Likes" does not have a significant relationship with the variable "Views" in the population. If the null hypothesis is rejected, accept the alternative hypothesis, indicating a significant relationship between "Likes" and "Views" in the population. Provide a conclusive analysis and interpretation of the findings, considering any limitations or potential sources of error in the study.

# In conclusion, our analysis led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, providing evidence that the variable "Likes" indeed has a significant relationship with the variable "Views" in the population. This finding supports the assertion that the number of likes received by a video is correlated with its corresponding number of views.
